This password meter is  a simple code using php,Js,html,css .
Designed and implemented in the standard password-strength algorithm:

 A password with characters from all four groups would need to be 11 
characters long to be OK (example: $5rfDweH65d) and 15 characters long to be 
Strong (example: $5rfDweH65dF6Gh).
A password with Mixed case letters and numbers would 
need to be 14 characters long to be OK (example: aG7d3rFdF9jgdG)
 and 19 characters long to be Strong (example: aG7d3rFdF9jgdG5gF0m).
A password with lowercase letters and numbers would need to be 16 characters long
 to be OK (example: h9e7dhncjus6glei) and 22 characters long to be Strong 
 (example: h9e7dhncjus6glei7djv9s).
